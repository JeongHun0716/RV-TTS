The greatest day in your life and mine is when we take total responsibility for our attitudes.
Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.
What we think determines what happens to us, so if we want to change our lives, we need to stretch our minds.
Life is ten percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you respond to it.
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring.
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.
Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don't resist them that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality.
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.
Literature adds to reality, it does not simply describe it. It enriches the necessary competencies that daily life requires and provides.
Remember your dreams and fight for them. You must know what you want from life.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
The ultimate value of life depends upon awareness and the power of contemplation rather than upon mere survival.
Transformation is a process, and as life happens there are tons of ups and downs.
Life is not about how fast you run or how high you climb, but how well you bounce.
